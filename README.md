# sbd-prediction
Based on your age, sex, total in kgs, and other parameters, I tried to make a regression model to predict your individual squat, bench press, and deadlift numbers.
Trained the model on the IPF (International Powerlifting Federation) dataset of raw meet records starting from 2014
Achieved pretty decent results, working on allowing user input for prediction...
